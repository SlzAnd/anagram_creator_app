Hi, my name is Andrii, and welcome to the Anagram creator project!

## What I used in this project:

- Java, Kotlin
- Android Framework
- JUnit
- Espresso

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once. (from Wikipedia)

## Project overview:

When you first open the app, you'll see a screen with two fields and an empty text field for the result:

<img src="./screenshots/first.png" width="306" height="658">


Users can enter the word for creating an anagram. If text with filtering symbols is empty, then ignored symbols are digits and non-alphabetic symbols

<img src="./screenshots/second.png" width="306" height="658">


If text with filtering symbols is not empty, then ignored symbols are entered by the user

<img src="./screenshots/third.png" width="306" height="658">

It's also works for Cyrillic input:

<img src="./screenshots/third_1.png" width="306" height="658">

Creation of anagram - automatic. The user immediately sees the result.

Also, I have unit tests for this project:

and UI tests using the Espresso framework:
