Hi, my name is Andrii, and welcome to the Anagram creator project!

## What I used in this project:

- Java, Kotlin
- Android Framework
- JUnit
- Espresso

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.(from Wikipedia)

## Project overview:

When you first open the app, you'll see a screen with two fields and empty text field for result:

<img src="./screenshots/first.png" width="306" height="658">


User can enter the word for creating anagram. If text with filtering symbols is empty, than ignored symbols are digits and non alphabetic symbols

<img src="./screenshots/second.png" width="306" height="658">


If text with filtering symbols is not empty, than ignored symbols are entered by user

<img src="./screenshots/third.png" width="306" height="658">

Creation of anagram - automatic. User immediately see the result.

It's also works for cyrillic input:

<img src="./screenshots/third_1.png" width="306" height="658">

Also I have unit tests for this project:

and UI tests using Espresso framework:
